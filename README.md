Hi, I'm Marco, a Full-Stack Developer from Brazil, I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development. Currently, I work as a service provider at MEI doing IT consulting.

I have always been passionate about technology. I started my career in the Technical course in Informatics and then entered the period of Analysis and Systems Development.

I am very hard-working, with a lot of desire to learn and learn very fast. I also like challenges and meeting new things.

I have skills with JavaScript, typescript, Node.js, ReactJS, React Native, Next.js, and SQL.

I’m studying the Node.js, ReactJS, and React Native stack, currently doing the Bootcamp Ignite, provided by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) which is adding a lot of knowledge with practical projects that are more aligned with the market. In addition, I love to study in a self-taught way to improve my skills and acquire new knowledge.
